## 6. Narrative
Caregivers log in and access the Reward Management dashboard, where they can curate the catalog to fit their family's needs. Children earn tokens through tasks and browse the catalog for exciting rewards. When ready, a child redeems tokens for a reward, triggering a request that the caregiver reviews and approves. The system tracks every step, ensuring transparency, safety, and a sense of accomplishment for both roles. All data and actions are managed locally, with no online dependencies.
