# PRD: User Management System

## 1. Product overview

### 1.1 Document title and version
* PRD: User Management System
* Version: 1.0

### 1.2 Product summary
* The User Management System enables caregivers to efficiently manage users (children and caregivers) within Arthur's Life App. The first caregiver account created for a family is always assigned the admin role by default. It provides secure, role-based access for caregivers to add, edit, deactivate, and view user profiles, ensuring compliance with child safety and privacy standards. The system supports onboarding, role assignment, and user data management, with a focus on accessibility and performance.

## 2. Goals

### 2.1 Business goals
* Enable caregivers to manage users securely and efficiently
* Ensure compliance with child safety and privacy regulations
* Improve onboarding and user lifecycle management
* Support scalable user management for families

### 2.2 User goals
* Caregivers can add, edit, deactivate, and view users
* Assign roles (child, caregiver) during onboarding
* Access user management features with intuitive UI
* Ensure user data is secure and private

### 2.3 Non-goals
* Direct user management by children
* Third-party integrations for user management
* Advanced analytics or reporting beyond basic user data

## 3. User personas

### 3.1 Key user types
* Caregiver (primary user)
