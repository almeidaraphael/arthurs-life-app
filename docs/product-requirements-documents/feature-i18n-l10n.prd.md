# PRD: Internationalization and Localization System

## 1. Product overview

### 1.1 Document title and version

- PRD: Internationalization and Localization System
- Version: 1.0.0

### 1.2 Product summary

- This document defines the requirements for a comprehensive Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n) system for LemonQwest App. The goal is to enable seamless language and region support, starting with EN-US and PT-BR, across all features, screens, and dialogs, ensuring a consistent, accessible, and culturally relevant user experience.
- The i18n/l10n system will allow users to select their preferred language and region, with all UI text, date/time formats, and culturally sensitive content adapting accordingly. The system will be designed for scalability, maintainability, and performance, supporting future language/region additions with minimal effort.

## 2. Goals

### 2.1 Business goals

- Expand user base to non-English speakers, starting with Brazilian Portuguese.
- Increase user engagement and satisfaction by providing a native-language experience.
- Ensure compliance with accessibility and child safety standards in all supported languages.
- Enable rapid rollout of additional languages/regions in future releases.

### 2.2 User goals

- Use the app in their preferred language (EN-US or PT-BR) with accurate, culturally relevant content.
- Easily switch languages/regions from within the app settings.
- Experience consistent terminology, icons, and flows regardless of language.
- Access all features, help, and onboarding in their chosen language.

### 2.3 Non-goals

## 5. User experience

### 5.1 Entry points & first-time user flow

- Language selection prompt on first launch (with device locale as default).
- Language/region can be changed anytime via settings.
- Onboarding, help, and all screens respect selected language from the start.

### 5.2 Core experience

- **Language Selection**: User selects language in settings; all UI updates instantly.
  - Ensures users always interact in their preferred language.
- **Localized Navigation**: All navigation, dialogs, and notifications are localized.
  - Ensures a seamless, consistent experience across all features.
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Terminology and icons adapt to locale and role.
  - Maintains engagement and clarity for all user types.

### 5.3 Advanced features & edge cases

- Fallback to EN-US for missing translations.
- Support for pluralization and gendered language where relevant.
- All error and system messages are localized.
- Language switching does not disrupt ongoing tasks or unsaved data.

### 5.4 UI/UX highlights

- Consistent terminology and iconography across all screens.
- Accessible language switcher with clear labels and feedback.
- All text is readable, with proper contrast and font scaling.
- No hardcoded strings; all content is translatable.

## 6. Narrative

When a user launches LemonQwest App, they are greeted in their device's language, with the option to switch to another supported language at any time. All screens, dialogs, and notifications instantly reflect their choice, with culturally relevant terminology and icons. Whether a child in Brazil or a caregiver in the US, every user enjoys a seamless, accessible, and engaging experience in their native language, with no performance trade-offs.

## 7. Success metrics
