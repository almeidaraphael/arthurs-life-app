## 📖 Main Content

### Section 1: Core Concepts

#### Code of Conduct
- Prioritize child safety, privacy, and well-being.
- Maintain high code quality and documentation standards.
- Communicate respectfully and inclusively.
- Support educational value and positive behavior reinforcement.

### Section 2: Implementation Details

#### Development Setup
**Prerequisites:**
- Java 21 (preferred) or Java 17 (fallback)
- Android Studio (latest)
- Android SDK API level 24+
- Git

**Quick Setup:**
```zsh
# Verify Java version
java -version  # Should show Java 21 or Java 17

# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd arthurs-life-app/android-kotlin

# Build and verify
./gradlew build
./gradlew ktlintCheck
./gradlew detekt
./gradlew test
```

#### Workflow & Best Practices
1. Start with Domain Layer
2. Implement Use Cases
3. Add Infrastructure
4. Build UI
5. Wire Dependencies
6. Test Thoroughly

Patterns to Follow:
- DDD, SOLID, DRY
- Repository pattern
- MVVM architecture
- Dependency Injection (Hilt)
- Explicit imports only (no wildcards)
- No business logic in composables
- Use string resources (no hardcoded strings)
- Use named constants (no magic numbers)
- Prefer immutable data classes

#### Testing & Quality Assurance
- 80%+ test coverage required for domain layer
- Use JUnit, Espresso, MockK
- Run all checks before submitting:
  ```zsh
  ./gradlew detektFormat
  ./gradlew detekt
  ./gradlew build
  ./gradlew test
  ./gradlew installDebug
  ```
- All tests and static analysis must pass (ZERO Detekt violations)
- Use descriptive test names (Given-When-Then)
- Mock external dependencies

#### Accessibility & Child Safety
- All UI must support TalkBack and semantic roles
- Minimum 4.5:1 color contrast
- Input validation and secure storage
- COPPA compliance
- Provide `contentDescription` for images
- Use `LazyColumn` for long lists

#### Commit & PR Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages (imperative mood)
- Reference related issues in PRs
- Ensure all checks pass before requesting review
- Document major architectural or pattern decisions in PR description
- Update documentation if you change APIs, workflows, or patterns
