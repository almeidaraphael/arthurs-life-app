## üéØ Design Principles

### Core Application Values
1. **Family-Centered Design** - Multi-child support with caregiver oversight
2. **Role-Based Access Control** - Clear separation between Child, Caregiver, and Admin capabilities  
3. **Token Economy Foundation** - Digital currency system for motivation and learning
4. **Offline-First Approach** - Local data storage with optional cloud sync
5. **Child Safety Priority** - Privacy protection and age-appropriate interactions

### Technical Principles
1. **Domain-Driven Design** - Business logic drives technical decisions
2. **SOLID Architecture** - Maintainable, extensible codebase
3. **DRY Implementation** - Reusable components and shared logic
4. **Accessibility Support** - TalkBack compatibility and inclusive design
5. **Quality Assurance** - Comprehensive testing and code quality standards

## üìã Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: MVP Features
**Goal**: Functional family task management with basic token economy

1. **User Management** - Child, Caregiver, Admin roles with PIN authentication
2. **Task System** - Create, assign, complete tasks with categories and difficulty
3. **Token Economy** - Earn tokens for task completion, basic spending system
4. **Reward Catalog** - Simple reward system with digital and physical options
5. **Progress Tracking** - Basic completion statistics and token balance

**Success Criteria**: Families can manage daily tasks and children can earn/spend tokens

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features  
**Goal**: Improved engagement and family coordination

1. **Achievement System** - Milestone recognition and progress gamification
2. **Advanced Analytics** - Detailed progress insights and family reporting
3. **Enhanced UI/UX** - Improved accessibility and responsive design
4. **Notification System** - Task reminders and completion celebrations
5. **Data Management** - Backup, restore, and data export capabilities

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
**Goal**: Comprehensive family productivity platform

1. **Wishlist System** - Save towards higher-cost rewards with progress tracking
2. **Multi-Child Management** - Advanced family coordination features
3. **Customization Options** - Personalized themes and reward categories
4. **Social Features** - Family sharing and collaborative goal setting
5. **Integration Capabilities** - Calendar sync and external service connections

## üîÑ Document Maintenance

### Documentation Standards
- Each document focuses on a specific domain with minimal overlap
- Cross-references between documents use relative links for maintainability
- Technical implementation details included where relevant for developers
- Regular reviews ensure consistency across all planning documents

### Update Process
1. **Requirements Changes** - Update requirements.md first, then cascade to affected documents
2. **Feature Additions** - Create new planning documents for significant features
3. **Architecture Changes** - Update app-structure.md and related technical documents
4. **UI/UX Changes** - Update wireframes.md and navigation.md together

## üöÄ Getting Started with Planning

### For Product Managers
1. Start with [requirements.md](requirements.md) for overall project scope
2. Review [mvp.md](mvp.md) for development prioritization
3. Study [app-structure.md](app-structure.md) for system architecture

### For Developers
1. Begin with [app-structure.md](app-structure.md) for technical overview
2. Follow [use-cases.md](use-cases.md) for feature implementation flows
3. Reference feature-specific documents for detailed requirements

### For Designers
1. Review [wireframes.md](wireframes.md) for visual design foundation
2. Study [navigation.md](navigation.md) for information architecture
3. Check [accessibility-features.md](accessibility-features.md) for inclusive design requirements
