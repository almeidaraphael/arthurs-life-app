# PRD: Test Suite Standardization

## 1. Product overview

### 1.1 Document title and version
* PRD: Test Suite Standardization
* Version: 1.0

### 1.2 Product summary
* This PRD defines the requirements and process for standardizing the test suite across all layers of Arthur's Life App. The goal is to ensure consistency, maintainability, and compliance with project standards, including explicit imports, descriptive test names, comprehensive coverage, and accessibility/child safety requirements.
* The standardized test suite will improve code quality, facilitate onboarding, and ensure all code passes Detekt and other quality gates.

## 2. Goals

### 2.1 Business goals
* Ensure code quality and reliability
* Facilitate maintainability and onboarding
* Support compliance and auditability

### 2.2 User goals
* Developers can easily write, read, and maintain tests
* QA can verify coverage and standards
* Automated tools can enforce quality gates

### 2.3 Non-goals
* Refactoring production code
* Adding new features outside of testing

## 3. User personas

### 3.1 Key user types
* Developer
* QA Engineer
* Maintainer

### 3.2 Basic persona details
* **Developer**: Implements and maintains features, writes tests
* **QA Engineer**: Verifies test coverage and standards
* **Maintainer**: Ensures codebase health and compliance

### 3.3 Role-based access
* **Developer**: Full access to test suite
* **QA Engineer**: Read/execute tests, report issues
* **Maintainer**: Approve changes, enforce standards

## 4. Functional requirements

* **Test File Structure Enforcement** (Priority: High)
  * All test files must follow package → explicit imports → code order.
* **Explicit Imports** (Priority: High)
  * No wildcard imports allowed in any test file.
* **Descriptive Test Names** (Priority: High)
  * All tests must use DisplayName annotations with Given-When-Then style.
* **Mocking Standards** (Priority: High)
  * Use MockK for mocking external dependencies.
* **Coverage Enforcement** (Priority: High)
  * Domain layer must maintain 80%+ test coverage.
* **Accessibility & Child Safety** (Priority: High)
  * UI tests must verify accessibility and child safety requirements.
* **Detekt Compliance** (Priority: High)
  * All test code must pass Detekt with zero violations.
* **No Business Logic in Composables** (Priority: High)
  * Composables must not contain business logic in tests.
* **Edge Case & Property-Based Testing** (Priority: Medium)
  * Include edge case and property-based tests where relevant.
* **Flow Testing** (Priority: Medium)
  * Use Turbine for Flow emission tests if applicable.

## 5. User experience

### 5.1 Entry points & first-time user flow
* New test files use a provided template
* Existing files are refactored to match standards

### 5.2 Core experience
* **Test Authoring**: Developers use the template and standards for all new and updated tests
  * Ensures consistency and reliability

### 5.3 Advanced features & edge cases
* Property-based and random data tests for robustness
* Accessibility and child safety checks in UI tests

### 5.4 UI/UX highlights
* Organized, readable, and maintainable test files
* Clear test names and structure

## 6. Narrative
Developers and QA engineers benefit from a standardized, reliable, and maintainable test suite. This ensures all code meets quality gates, is easy to understand, and supports accessibility and child safety, improving the overall health and compliance of the project.

## 7. Success metrics

### 7.1 User-centric metrics
* All test files follow the standard template
* Developers report improved maintainability

### 7.2 Business metrics
* 100% Detekt compliance in test code
* 80%+ domain test coverage

### 7.3 Technical metrics
* Zero wildcard imports
* All tests have DisplayName annotations
* All UI tests verify accessibility/child safety

## 8. Technical considerations

### 8.1 Integration points
* Domain, infrastructure, and presentation test files
* CI/CD pipeline for Detekt and coverage

### 8.2 Data storage & privacy
* No sensitive data in tests
* Mock data only

### 8.3 Scalability & performance
* Tests run efficiently in CI/CD
* Property-based tests do not slow down suite

### 8.4 Potential challenges
* Refactoring legacy test files
* Ensuring all contributors follow standards

## 9. Milestones & sequencing

### 9.1 Project estimate
* Medium: 1-2 weeks

### 9.2 Team size & composition
* 2-3 developers, 1 QA engineer

### 9.3 Suggested phases
* **Phase 1**: Audit and template creation (2 days)
  * Deliverable: Standard test template
* **Phase 2**: Refactor existing tests (5 days)
  * Deliverable: All test files standardized
* **Phase 3**: Add missing accessibility/child safety tests (2 days)
  * Deliverable: UI tests updated
* **Phase 4**: Final Detekt/coverage verification (1 day)
  * Deliverable: 100% compliance
