# Feature Documentation Standards

Guidelines for creating consistent, focused feature documentation in the `/planning/features/` directory.

## üìñ Purpose & Scope

### What Features Documentation Should Include
- **User experience descriptions** - How users interact with the feature
- **Business requirements** - What the feature must accomplish
- **User flows and scenarios** - Step-by-step user interactions
- **Integration points** - How the feature connects to other features
- **Success metrics** - How to measure feature effectiveness

### What Features Documentation Should NOT Include
- **Code implementation details** - These belong in `/docs/` technical documentation
- **Detailed technical architecture** - High-level integration only
- **Code snippets or examples** - Focus on requirements, not implementation
- **Database schemas or APIs** - Technical specifications go in `/docs/`

## üìù Document Structure

### Required Sections
All feature documents must include these sections:

1. **Feature Overview** - Purpose, capabilities, and user benefits
2. **User Experience** - User flows, interface elements, and interaction patterns
3. **Feature Requirements** - Functional, non-functional, and business rules
4. **Integration Points** - Dependencies, data requirements, and role-based behavior
5. **Success Metrics** - Engagement and business value measurements
6. **Implementation Status** - Current progress and future enhancements
7. **Related Documentation** - Cross-references to other planning and technical docs

### Optional Sections
Include these sections when relevant:

- **Migration Considerations** - For features replacing existing functionality
- **Risk Assessment** - For complex or high-risk features
- **Accessibility Requirements** - For features with specific accessibility needs
- **Compliance Requirements** - For features with regulatory or safety implications

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Guidelines

### Content Focus
- **User-centric**: Focus on what users can accomplish, not how it's built
- **Requirement-driven**: Emphasize what must be true, not how to make it true
- **Business-oriented**: Connect features to family outcomes and app objectives
- **Future-proof**: Describe desired end state, mark current implementation status

### Language and Tone
- **Clear and simple**: Use plain language appropriate for all stakeholders
- **Consistent terminology**: Use same terms for same concepts across documents
- **Active voice**: "Users can complete tasks" not "Tasks can be completed by users"
- **Present tense**: Describe features as they will exist when complete

### Technical Detail Level
- **High-level integration**: Describe how features connect, not implementation details
- **User-visible behavior**: Focus on what users see and experience
- **Business logic**: Include rules and constraints that affect user experience
- **Avoid implementation**: No code, schemas, or technical architecture

## üîó Cross-Referencing Standards

### Internal Links
- **Planning documents**: Use relative links within planning directory
- **Technical documents**: Link to docs/ for implementation details
- **Feature dependencies**: Link to other feature documents for integration points

### Link Format
```markdown
**Planning**: [Feature Name](feature-name.md) | [Planning Overview](../README.md)
**Technical**: [Architecture](../../docs/architecture.md) | [Implementation Guide](../../docs/feature-name.md)
```

### Navigation Standards
- Include breadcrumb navigation at the top
- Provide related documentation links at the bottom
- Use consistent link naming across all documents

## üìä Status Tracking

### Implementation Status
Mark the current implementation state for each feature:

- **Not Started**: No implementation begun
- **In Development**: Active development in progress
- **Partially Complete**: Some functionality implemented
- **Complete**: Full feature implementation finished

### MVP vs Future Scope
Clearly distinguish between:
- **MVP requirements**: Must-have functionality for initial release
- **Future enhancements**: Nice-to-have features for later releases

### Status Format
```markdown
## üöß Implementation Status

**Current Status**: Partially Complete

### MVP Scope
- [x] Core capability 1 (implemented)
- [ ] Core capability 2 (in progress)
- [ ] Core capability 3 (planned)

### Future Enhancements
- Enhancement 1: Low priority, post-MVP
- Enhancement 2: Medium priority, version 2.0
```

## üéØ Quality Standards

### Review Checklist
Before finalizing feature documentation:

- [ ] Uses standard template structure
- [ ] Focuses on user experience and requirements
- [ ] Contains no code or implementation details
- [ ] Links properly to related documentation
- [ ] Includes implementation status information
- [ ] Uses consistent terminology throughout
- [ ] Provides clear success metrics

### Maintenance Guidelines
- **Regular reviews**: Update when requirements change
- **Status updates**: Keep implementation status current
- **Cross-reference validation**: Ensure links remain valid
- **Terminology consistency**: Maintain consistent language across features

## üîÑ Template Usage

### Starting a New Feature Document
1. Copy `/planning/features/TEMPLATE.md`
2. Rename to match feature name using kebab-case
3. Replace all placeholder content
4. Focus on user value and business requirements
5. Link to related features and technical documentation

### Converting Existing Documents
1. Review current document against template structure
2. Remove technical implementation details
3. Reorganize content to match standard sections
4. Add missing sections (especially status and metrics)
5. Update cross-references to match standards
