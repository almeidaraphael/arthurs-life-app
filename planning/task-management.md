## Task User Flows

### Task Completion Flow (Child)
1. Home screen → views today's assigned tasks
2. Selects task → reads instructions and requirements
3. Starts task → optional timer begins
4. Completes task → marks as complete with visual feedback
5. Receives tokens → celebrates completion with animation
6. Updates streak → achievement system checks for triggers
7. Views progress → sees daily completion percentage

### Task Assignment Flow (Caregiver)
1. Dashboard → selects child from dropdown
2. Tasks screen → views child's current task list
3. Add Task → chooses from templates or creates custom
4. Configures task:
   - Sets difficulty level and token reward
   - Assigns schedule and recurrence pattern
   - Adds instructions and completion notes
   - Sets reminders and preferred completion time
5. Saves task → task appears in child's task list
6. Monitors progress → tracks completion and adjusts as needed

### Task Management Flow (Admin)
1. Dashboard → family task overview
2. Task Templates → creates family-wide task templates
3. Bulk Operations → applies tasks across multiple children
4. Task Analytics → reviews family task completion trends
5. Template Sharing → creates reusable task patterns
6. Quality Control → reviews and approves caregiver task assignments

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```kotlin
data class Task(
    val id: String,
    val title: String,
    val description: String,
    val category: TaskCategory,
    val difficulty: TaskDifficulty,
    val tokenReward: Int,
    val schedule: TaskSchedule,
    val status: TaskStatus,
    val assignedToUserId: String,
    val createdByUserId: String,
    val instructions: String?,
    val estimatedDuration: Duration?,
    val preferredCompletionTime: LocalTime?,
    val isRecurring: Boolean,
    val recurringPattern: RecurringPattern?,
    val createdAt: Timestamp,
    val updatedAt: Timestamp
)

data class TaskCompletion(
    val id: String,
    val taskId: String,
    val userId: String,
    val completedAt: Timestamp,
    val tokensEarned: Int,
    val notes: String?,
    val completionTime: Duration?,
    val validatedBy: String?
)

enum class TaskCategory {
    PERSONAL_CARE, HOUSEHOLD_CHORES, HOMEWORK, 
    SOCIAL_SKILLS, EXERCISE, CREATIVE, OTHER
}

enum class TaskDifficulty(val multiplier: Float) {
    EASY(1.0f), MEDIUM(1.5f), HARD(2.0f)
}

enum class TaskStatus {
    ACTIVE, PAUSED, ARCHIVED, DRAFT
}
```

### Task Operations
- Create, read, update, delete tasks
- Task assignment and scheduling
- Completion tracking and validation
- Progress calculation and analytics
- Family task coordination and sharing
- Template creation and management

### Recurring Task Logic
```kotlin
fun generateRecurringTasks(task: Task, startDate: LocalDate, endDate: LocalDate): List<Task> {
    return when (task.recurringPattern) {
        RecurringPattern.DAILY -> generateDailyTasks(task, startDate, endDate)
        RecurringPattern.WEEKLY -> generateWeeklyTasks(task, startDate, endDate)
        RecurringPattern.WEEKDAYS -> generateWeekdayTasks(task, startDate, endDate)
        RecurringPattern.WEEKENDS -> generateWeekendTasks(task, startDate, endDate)
        RecurringPattern.CUSTOM -> generateCustomTasks(task, startDate, endDate)
    }
}
```

### Task Validation & Safety
