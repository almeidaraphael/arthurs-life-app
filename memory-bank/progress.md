## Progress Overview (Updated 2025-07-30)

This document summarizes the current implementation status of the LemonQwest App Android codebase (`android-kotlin`) with focus on the **Test Isolation Migration â€“ PARTIAL SUCCESS**.

## ðŸš¨ MIGRATION STATUS CORRECTION â€“ PARTIAL SUCCESS

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Total test files**: 153 (48 unit + 105 integration)
- **Modern pattern adoption**: 43 files (~28%)
- **Legacy/unknown patterns**: 110 files (~72%)
- **Unit Tests with LemonQwestTestExtension**: 27/48 files (56% adoption)
- **DAO Tests with DatabaseTestBase**: 16/17+ files (94% DAO adoption)
- **Integration/UI Tests with ComposeUiTestBase**: 60+ files (appropriate pattern)

### Qualitative Metrics
- **Thread-Safe Parallel Execution**: Only modernized tests support parallel execution
- **Zero State Bleeding**: Verified for migrated tests; legacy tests may have isolation issues
- **Consistent Patterns**: Modern patterns in 43 files; legacy patterns remain in 110+ files
- **Documentation**: CLAUDE.md and Memory Bank updated to reflect actual migration status

### Key Findings
- **Partial Infrastructure Adoption**: LemonQwestTestExtension and DatabaseTestBase used in 43 files
- **Incomplete Coverage**: Significant legacy patterns remain in majority of test suite
- **Migration Plan Inaccurate**: Previous claims of 100% completion were overoptimistic
- **Evidence-Based Tracking**: All migrations tracked with before/after code, build/test/lint results

### Next Steps
- Migrate remaining 110+ legacy test files to modern patterns
- Prioritize high-value domain and integration tests for migration
- Continue evidence-based tracking and documentation
- Update CLAUDE.md and Memory Bank as migration progresses
