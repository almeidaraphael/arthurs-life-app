## Project Progress Overview

This document tracks the current state of the Arthur's Life App project. It is updated regularly to reflect what works, what remains to be built, the current status, and any known issues. This ensures rapid onboarding and continuity after memory resets.

## ‚úÖ What Works
- **Core Architecture**: Clean Architecture with Domain, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers is established.
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt is set up for dependency injection.
- **Core UI**: Jetpack Compose is used for the UI, with a clear separation of components, screens, and viewmodels.
- **Feature - User Management**: Screens for caregiver to manage children and for user selection are implemented.
- **Feature - Profile System**: Screens for both child and caregiver profiles are implemented.
- **Feature - Task System**: Screens for both child and caregiver task management are implemented.
- **Feature - Reward System**: Screens for both child and caregiver reward management are implemented.
- **Feature - Achievement System**: A screen for child achievements is implemented.
- **Feature - Onboarding**: The basic structure for the onboarding flow is in place.
- **Feature - Theme System**: A screen for theme settings is implemented.
- **Feature - User Switching**: A dialog for switching users is implemented.
- **PRDs**: Product Requirements Documents for all major features are created and available in `/docs/product-requirements-documents/`.

## üöß What's Left to Build
- **Feature - Bottom Navigation Bar**: While individual screens exist, a unified bottom navigation bar as per the PRD is not yet fully implemented or integrated.
- **Feature - Data Management**: Secure local storage, backup/restore, and export/import functionalities need implementation.
- **Feature - i18n & l10n**: The app needs to be localized for PT-BR, including all string resources and date/time formats.
- **Feature - Reward Suggestion System**: The workflow for children to suggest rewards and for caregivers to approve them is not yet implemented.
- **Feature - Top Navigation Bar**: A persistent, role-based top navigation bar needs to be implemented across all screens.
- **Testing**: Achieve 80%+ test coverage for the domain layer.
- **Static Analysis**: Enforce Detekt and KtLint rules across the codebase.

## üìä Current Status
- **In Progress**: Integrating individual feature screens into a cohesive application flow with proper navigation.
- **Next Steps**:
    1. Implement the Top and Bottom Navigation Bars to unify the user experience.
    2. Implement the Data Management system to ensure data persistence and security.
    3. Begin localization for PT-BR.
- **Blocked**: No blockers currently identified.

## üêû Known Issues
- Navigation between screens is not yet fully implemented or unified.
- State management across different screens and user roles needs to be refined.
- The app is not yet fully theme-aware across all components as per the `feature-theme-system.md` PRD.
