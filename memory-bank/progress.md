## Progress Overview (as of 2025-07-16)

This document summarizes the current implementation status of the Arthur's Life App Android codebase (`android-kotlin`) as mapped to the Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) in `/docs/product-requirements-documents/`.

### What Works (Feature Coverage)

- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: Fully implemented and PRD-compliant. Role-based, theme-aware, max 4 tabs, dynamic content, accessibility support. (`MainAppNavigation.kt`, `BottomNavItem.kt`, `BottomNavViewModel.kt`)
- **Family Setup & Onboarding**: Guided onboarding, family creation, role assignment, and validation are complete. (`FamilySetupScreen.kt`, onboarding screens)
- **Profile System**: Users can view/edit info, avatar, theme, accessibility, and PIN. (`ProfileScreen.kt`, `ProfileCustomizationScreen.kt`, domain/user)
- **Reward Management**: Caregiver and child reward flows, catalog, redemption, approval, and history are implemented. (`CaregiverRewardManagementScreen.kt`, `ChildRewardScreen.kt`, domain/reward)
- **Task Management**: Task creation, assignment, completion, stats, and token integration are present. (`CaregiverTaskManagementScreen.kt`, `ChildTaskScreen.kt`, domain/task)
- **User Switching**: User selection and switching dialogs/screens are present. (`UserSelectionScreen.kt`, `UserSwitchDialog.kt`)
- **Token Economy**: Token logic integrated with tasks and rewards. (`TokenBalance.kt`, task/reward domain)
- **Achievement System (Child)**: Child achievement viewing, progress, and celebration are implemented. (`ChildAchievementScreen.kt`, domain/achievement)

### In Development (Following Feature Priority)

**Priority 1-2: Bottom Navigation Bar** âœ… **COMPLETED**
- All core navigation functionality implemented
- PRD fixes completed (4-tab maximum, correct labels, admin logic)

**Priority 3: Top Navigation Bar** ðŸš§ **PENDING**
- State management design phase
- Dialog system architecture planning
- Integration with existing UI components

**Priority 4: Theme System** ðŸš§ **PENDING**  
- Data layer architecture design
- State management planning
- Integration with existing theme components

### Task Organization Status

Tasks have been reorganized by feature following the specified priority order:
1. **Bottom Navigation Bar (TASK001-TASK006)** - âœ… All completed
2. **Bottom Navigation Bar PRD Fixes (TASK007-TASK012)** - âœ… TASK007 completed, others pending
3. **Top Navigation Bar (TASK013-TASK019)** - ðŸš§ All pending
4. **Theme System (TASK020-TASK025)** - ðŸš§ All pending  
5. **Final Verification (TASK026)** - ðŸš§ Pending

### What's Left to Build

**Immediate Next Steps (Following Priority Order):**
- Complete Bottom Navigation Bar PRD fixes (TASK008-TASK012)
- Implement Top Navigation Bar feature (TASK013-TASK019)
- Implement Theme System feature (TASK020-TASK025)
- Final PRD compliance verification (TASK026)

**Future Features (Lower Priority):**
- Data export/import UI and audit logs for Data Management
- Full dynamic language switching and persistent i18n/l10n support
- Caregiver/Admin achievement management and analytics
- Advanced privacy management and compliance UI
- Additional accessibility enhancements and validation

### Current Status

- **Core user flows (onboarding, navigation, profile, tasks, rewards, achievements, user switching)** are implemented and integrated.
- **Most domain aggregates and repositories** are present and follow Clean Architecture + DDD.
- **UI is Jetpack Compose, theme-aware, and role-based.**
- **Task organization follows feature-based priority structure** for efficient development workflow.

### Known Issues / Gaps

- Top Navigation Bar and Theme System features are in planning phase
- Full i18n/l10n and dynamic language switching are not confirmed
- Some advanced admin/caregiver features (e.g., achievement management, analytics, audit logs) may be incomplete
- Data export/import and audit log features need UI implementation
- Some features may be implemented but not fully integrated or exposed in the UI
