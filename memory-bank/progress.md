## Progress Overview (as of 2025-07-16)

This document summarizes the current implementation status of the Arthur's Life App Android codebase (`android-kotlin`) as mapped to the Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) in `/docs/product-requirements-documents/`.

### What Works (Feature Coverage)

- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: Fully implemented. Role-based, theme-aware, max 4 tabs, dynamic content, accessibility support. (`MainAppNavigation.kt`, `BottomNavItem.kt`, `BottomNavViewModel.kt`)
- **Family Setup & Onboarding**: Guided onboarding, family creation, role assignment, and validation are complete. (`FamilySetupScreen.kt`, onboarding screens)
- **Profile System**: Users can view/edit info, avatar, theme, accessibility, and PIN. (`ProfileScreen.kt`, `ProfileCustomizationScreen.kt`, domain/user)
- **Reward Management**: Caregiver and child reward flows, catalog, redemption, approval, and history are implemented. (`CaregiverRewardManagementScreen.kt`, `ChildRewardScreen.kt`, domain/reward)
- **Task Management**: Task creation, assignment, completion, stats, and token integration are present. (`CaregiverTaskManagementScreen.kt`, `ChildTaskScreen.kt`, domain/task)
- **Theme System**: Role-based, dynamic, Mario/Material themes, accessibility support. (`ThemeViewModel.kt`, `AppTheme.kt`, theme folders)
- **User Switching**: User selection and switching dialogs/screens are present. (`UserSelectionScreen.kt`, `UserSwitchDialog.kt`)
- **Token Economy**: Token logic integrated with tasks and rewards. (`TokenBalance.kt`, task/reward domain)
- **Achievement System (Child)**: Child achievement viewing, progress, and celebration are implemented. (`ChildAchievementScreen.kt`, domain/achievement)

### In Progress / Partial

- **Achievement System (Caregiver/Admin, Analytics)**: Caregiver management, advanced analytics, and admin features are not fully visible.
- **Data Management**: Secure storage and preferences are present, but explicit backup/export UI, audit logs, and privacy management screens are not confirmed.
- **Internationalization/Localization**: Some resource structure exists, but dynamic language switching and full i18n/l10n support are not confirmed.
- **Advanced Admin Features**: Some advanced caregiver/admin features (e.g., audit logs, advanced analytics) are not fully implemented.

### Whatâ€™s Left to Build

- Data export/import UI and audit logs for Data Management
- Full dynamic language switching and persistent i18n/l10n support
- Caregiver/Admin achievement management and analytics
- Advanced privacy management and compliance UI
- Additional accessibility enhancements and validation (if not already covered)
- Any missing integration points between features (e.g., analytics, notifications)

### Current Status

- **Core user flows (onboarding, navigation, profile, tasks, rewards, achievements, theme, user switching)** are implemented and integrated.
- **Most domain aggregates and repositories** are present and follow Clean Architecture + DDD.
- **UI is Jetpack Compose, theme-aware, and role-based.**
- **Testing, static analysis, and accessibility** are referenced in standards, but test coverage and static analysis results are not reviewed here.

### Known Issues / Gaps

- Data export/import and audit log features are not visible in the UI or domain.
- Full i18n/l10n and dynamic language switching are not confirmed.
- Some advanced admin/caregiver features (e.g., achievement management, analytics, audit logs) may be incomplete.
- No explicit evidence of automated backup/restore UI or privacy management screens.
- Some features may be implemented but not fully integrated or exposed in the UI.
