## Project Overview

LemonQwest App is a family-oriented, native Android application designed to motivate children and support caregivers through a gamified task, reward, and achievement system. The app enables children to view and complete tasks, earn tokens, unlock achievements, and redeem rewards in a safe, accessible, and engaging environment. Caregivers can create, assign, and monitor tasks, manage multiple children, and analyze progress with actionable insights. All features are designed for offline-first operation, accessibility, and child safety.
