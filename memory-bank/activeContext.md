## Current Work Focus & Achievements

### ðŸš¨ MIGRATION STATUS CORRECTION â€“ PARTIAL SUCCESS

- **Partial Infrastructure Adoption**: LemonQwestTestExtension used in 27 unit tests, DatabaseTestBase in 16 DAO tests
- **Incomplete Coverage**: Total 153 test files exist (48 unit + 105 integration) vs 43 using modern patterns
- **Migration Plan Inaccurate**: Previous claims of 100% completion were overoptimistic; actual adoption is ~28%
- **Remaining Work**: 110+ test files still using legacy patterns or need analysis

### Key Findings (2025-07-30)
- **27 Unit Tests Using LemonQwestTestExtension**: Domain business rules, validation, creation, edge cases, collections, use case tests
- **16 DAO Tests Using DatabaseTestBase**: Core DAO operations with automated database management
- **110+ Legacy Tests**: Still using older patterns, manual setup, or require analysis
- **Evidence**: Verified migrations show proper modern patterns in place, but significant remaining work identified

### Reality Check Summary
- **Total test files**: 153 (48 unit + 105 integration)
- **Modern pattern adoption**: 43 files (~28%)
- **Remaining legacy/unknown**: 110 files (~72%)
- **Migration plan was significantly overoptimistic in claims**

## Next Steps
- Migrate remaining 110+ legacy test files to modern patterns
- Prioritize high-value domain and integration tests for migration
- Continue evidence-based tracking and documentation
- Update CLAUDE.md and Memory Bank as migration progresses

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Modern Test Infrastructure**: LemonQwestTestExtension and DatabaseTestBase are the standard for new/migrated tests
- **Parallel Execution**: Enabled for migrated tests; legacy tests may not be thread-safe
- **Documentation Synchronized**: All guides must reflect actual migration status and patterns
- **Evidence Required**: Each migration must be tracked with before/after code, build/test/lint results

## Source of Truth

The test isolation migration is ongoing. All documentation and Memory Bank files must reflect the actual, evidence-based status. Modern patterns are adopted in 43 files; legacy patterns remain in 110+ files. Migration progress and evidence are tracked in TEST_ISOLATION_MIGRATION_PLAN.md and CLAUDE.md.
