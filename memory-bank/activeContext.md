## Current Work Focus
- Assessing current implementation status and aligning with Memory Bank task management standards
- Existing substantial implementation verified: 294 Kotlin source files, 58 test files
- Domain layer fully implemented with all core aggregates (Task, Reward, Achievement, User)
- Infrastructure layer complete with repository implementations and data sources
- Presentation layer extensively implemented with multiple screens and navigation
- Theme system architecture in place with semantic icon mapping and role-based theming
- All quality gates currently met: successful builds, passing tests, zero Detekt violations
- **Important**: No implementation plans exist in `/docs/implementation-plans/` yet
- Following Memory Bank policy: No tasks can be created without corresponding implementation plans
- Ready to create implementation plans and corresponding tasks following proper workflow

## Recent Changes
- Documentation restructure completed: moved from planning/ to docs/product-requirements-documents/ and docs/implementation-plans/ (2025-07-15)
- Tasks folder reset to comply with Memory Bank standards requiring implementation plans first (2025-07-15)
- Extensive implementation progress verified: 294 Kotlin source files, 58 test files implemented
- Core domain layer complete: Task, Reward, Achievement, User aggregates with full business logic
- Infrastructure layer complete: Repository implementations, data sources, and mappers
- Presentation layer substantially implemented: Multiple screens, navigation, theme system
- All quality gates met: Build success, tests passing, zero Detekt violations
- Theme system architecture implemented with role-based theming and semantic icon mapping

## Next Steps
- Create implementation plans in `/docs/implementation-plans/` following `implementation-plan.chatmode.md` standards
- Implementation plans needed for: Task system integration, Analytics dashboard, Accessibility audit
- Once implementation plans exist, create corresponding tasks in memory-bank/tasks/
- Continue theme system integration and semantic icon mapping refinements
- Validate accessibility compliance and child safety implementation
- Prepare for comprehensive testing validation and coverage verification
- Plan for user testing and feedback integration

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- All requirements, standards, and priorities are derived from the latest PRDs and updated documentation in `docs/`
- In case of documentation conflict, PRDs take precedence
- All code, tests, and documentation must be cross-referenced and kept in sync

## Source of Truth
This active context is based on the most recent PRDs and updated documentation in `docs/`. All priorities and next steps are aligned with those documents. In case of conflict, PRDs override all other sources.
