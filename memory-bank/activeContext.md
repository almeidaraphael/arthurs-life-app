## Current Work Focus
- **Task Reorganization Complete**: Tasks reorganized by feature following priority order: bottom-navigation-bar → bottom-navigation-bar-prd-fixes → top-navigation-bar → theme-system
- All tasks now follow logical feature sequence with updated IDs and cross-references
- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: Feature complete - all core tasks (TASK001-TASK007) implemented and tested
- **Next Priority**: Complete Bottom Navigation Bar PRD Fixes (TASK008-TASK012) to ensure full PRD compliance
- Ready to begin Top Navigation Bar feature development (TASK013-TASK019) following implementation plan
- Theme System feature (TASK020-TASK025) prepared with complete implementation plan and task structure

## Recent Changes
- **2025-07-16**: Complete task reorganization by feature priority
  - Tasks renumbered to follow feature sequence: TASK001-006 (bottom nav), TASK007-012 (PRD fixes), TASK013-019 (top nav), TASK020-025 (theme system)
  - Updated all task files with correct IDs, cross-references, and progress tracking
  - Recreated `_index.md` with feature-based organization and clear priority structure
  - Updated `progress.md` to reflect reorganized development workflow
- **2025-07-15**: Documentation restructure and implementation verification completed
- All quality gates maintained: successful builds, passing tests, zero Detekt violations
- Extensive implementation verified: 294 Kotlin source files, 58 test files, complete domain/infrastructure/presentation layers

## Next Steps (Following Feature Priority)
1. **Complete Bottom Navigation Bar PRD Fixes** (TASK008-TASK012)
   - Add admin status to user model
   - Update authentication preferences
   - Implement admin-based tab logic
   - Fix tab labels to match PRD requirements
   - Update tests for 4-tab structure

2. **Implement Top Navigation Bar Feature** (TASK013-TASK019)
   - Define top bar state management
   - Create top navigation bar composable
   - Implement required dialogs (Profile, Settings, User Selector)
   - Create dialog management system
   - Integrate into main app UI

3. **Implement Theme System Feature** (TASK020-TASK025)
   - Define theme data layer (AppTheme enum, DataStore, Repository)
   - Provide theme dependencies via Hilt
   - Create theme state management (ThemeViewModel)
   - Implement theme selector dialog with previews
   - Create top-level theme provider

4. **Final Verification** (TASK026)
   - Comprehensive PRD compliance verification across all features

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Feature-First Development**: Tasks organized by complete features rather than mixed development
- **PRD Compliance Priority**: Bottom navigation bar PRD fixes take precedence before new feature development
- **Documentation Synchronization**: All task files, implementation plans, and PRDs kept in sync
- **Memory Bank Standards**: All tasks derive from implementation plans which derive from PRDs (strict hierarchy)

## Source of Truth
This active context reflects the reorganized task structure and feature-based development approach. All priorities follow the feature priority order specified in the task reorganization request. Implementation plans in `/docs/implementation-plan-documents/` and PRDs in `/docs/product-requirements-documents/` remain the authoritative sources for all feature requirements and technical specifications.
