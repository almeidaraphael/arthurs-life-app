# [TASK023] - Implement Theme Selector Dialog

**Status:** Pending
**Added:** 2025-07-15

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan:** [docs/implementation-plan-documents/feature-theme-system.ipd.md](docs/implementation-plan-documents/feature-theme-system.ipd.md)

## Original Request
Create a composable dialog that displays the list of available themes. It will observe the current theme from `ThemeViewModel` and call the update function upon user selection. It will include previews for each theme.

## Thought Process
The `ThemeSelectorDialog` is the primary user interface for changing themes. It needs to be intuitive and provide clear feedback. Including theme previews within the dialog is a key UX requirement to help users make an informed choice.
