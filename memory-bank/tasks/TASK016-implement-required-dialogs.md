# [TASK016] - Implement Required Dialogs

**Status:** Pending
**Added:** 2025-07-15
**Updated:** 2025-07-15

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan:** [docs/implementation-plans/feature-top-navigation-bar.md](docs/implementation-plans/feature-top-navigation-bar.md)
**Source PRD:** [docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-top-navigation-bar.md](docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-top-navigation-bar.md)

## Original Request
Create or refactor the required dialog composables. Ensure they are self-contained and can be triggered from the top bar.

## Thought Process
The top bar acts as a trigger for many different dialogs. This task involves ensuring all these dialogs (`ProfileDialog`, `SettingsDialog`, etc.) are implemented as clean, reusable composables. They should be independent of the screen they are shown on, receiving all necessary data and callbacks as parameters.

## Implementation Plan Reference

- **Description**: Implement Required Dialogs
- **Files to Edit/Create**: `ProfileDialog.kt`, `SettingsDialog.kt`, `UserSelectorDialog.kt`, etc.
