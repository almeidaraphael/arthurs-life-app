# [TASK018] - Integrate Top Bar into Main App UI

**Status:** Pending
**Added:** 2025-07-15
**Updated:** 2025-07-15

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan:** [docs/implementation-plans/feature-top-navigation-bar.md](docs/implementation-plans/feature-top-navigation-bar.md)

## Original Request
Add the `TopAppBar` to the main app scaffold, ensuring it's placed correctly and receives the `TopBarState`.

## Thought Process
This is the final integration step for the top bar UI. Placing it in the `topBar` slot of the main `AppScaffold` ensures it is displayed consistently across all relevant screens. It will be driven by the state exposed by the `TopBarViewModel`.
