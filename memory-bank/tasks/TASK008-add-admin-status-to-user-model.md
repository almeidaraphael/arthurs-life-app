# [TASK008] - Add Admin Status to User Model

**Status:** Pending
**Added:** 2025-07-16
**Updated:** 2025-07-16

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan:** [docs/implementation-plans/feature-bottom-navigation-bar-prd-fixes.md](docs/implementation-plans/feature-bottom-navigation-bar-prd-fixes.md)
**Source PRD:** [docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-bottom-navigation-bar.md](docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-bottom-navigation-bar.md)

## Original Request
Add admin status differentiation to support Users vs Children tab for caregivers as required by PRD.

## Thought Process
The PRD specifies that caregivers must have different fourth tabs based on admin status:
- Family Admin: Shows "Users" tab
- Non-Admin: Shows "Children" tab

Currently, the User domain model doesn't have an admin status property. We need to add this to enable proper role-based navigation.

## Implementation Plan Reference
- Add isAdmin boolean property to User domain model
- Update User constructor and documentation
- Ensure serialization compatibility
- Add helper methods if needed

## Progress Tracking
