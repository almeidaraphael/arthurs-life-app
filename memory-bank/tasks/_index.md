## Important Note
According to Memory Bank policy, **NO tasks can be created without corresponding implementation plans** in `/docs/implementation-plans/`. 

The implementation plans must:
- Follow the template and standards defined in `implementation-plan.chatmode.md`
- Be created before any task creation
- Provide detailed technical execution plans derived from specific PRDs

**Current Status**: No implementation plans exist in `/docs/implementation-plans/`. Tasks cannot be created until implementation plans are properly established.

**Next Step**: Create implementation plans following `implementation-plan.chatmode.md` standards, then create corresponding tasks in this folder.
