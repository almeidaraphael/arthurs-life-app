# [TASK015] - Implement the Top Navigation Bar Composable

**Status:** Pending
**Added:** 2025-07-15
**Updated:** 2025-07-15

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan:** [docs/implementation-plans/feature-top-navigation-bar.md](docs/implementation-plans/feature-top-navigation-bar.md)

## Original Request
Create a composable that renders the UI based on the `TopBarState`. It will handle the layout of elements and delegate click events to the ViewModel or a navigation handler.

## Thought Process
This is the core UI component for the top navigation bar. It should be a stateless composable that receives the `TopBarState` and callbacks for user interactions. This keeps the UI logic separate from the state management logic, which is handled by the `TopBarViewModel`.
