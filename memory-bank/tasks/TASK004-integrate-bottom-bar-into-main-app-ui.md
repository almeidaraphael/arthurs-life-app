# [TASK004] - Integrate Bottom Bar into Main App UI

**Status:** Pending
**Added:** 2025-07-15
**Updated:** 2025-07-15

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan:** [docs/implementation-plans/feature-bottom-navigation-bar.md](docs/implementation-plans/feature-bottom-navigation-bar.md)

## Original Request
Integrate the `BottomNavigationBar` into the main app scaffold. The scaffold will manage the visibility of the bottom bar based on the current route.

## Thought Process
This is the integration step where the new component becomes part of the main application UI. Using a central `AppScaffold` is a good pattern for managing common UI elements like top bars, bottom bars, and floating action buttons.
