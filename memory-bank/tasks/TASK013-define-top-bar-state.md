# [TASK013] - Define Top Bar State

**Status:** Completed
**Added:** 2025-07-15
**Updated:** 2025-07-17

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan:** [docs/implementation-plan-documents/feature-top-navigation-bar.ipd.md](docs/implementation-plan-documents/feature-top-navigation-bar.ipd.md)
**Source PRD:** [docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-top-navigation-bar.prd.md](docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-top-navigation-bar.prd.md)

## Original Request
Create a data class `TopBarState` to model all possible elements of the top bar (avatar, token balance, progress, etc.). Create a `TopBarViewModel` to build and expose a `StateFlow<TopBarState>` based on the current user role and navigation route.

## Thought Process
Centralizing the top bar's state into a `TopBarState` data class and managing it with a dedicated `TopBarViewModel` is a clean architectural approach. It decouples the UI from the complex logic of determining what to show based on user role and current screen, making the system more maintainable and testable.

## Implementation Plan Reference
- **Task ID**: TASK-001 (from plan)
- **Description**: Define Top Bar State
- **Files to Edit/Create**: `TopBarState.kt`, `TopBarViewModel.kt`
- **Details**: Create a data class `TopBarState` to model all possible elements of the top bar (avatar, token balance, progress, etc.). Create a `TopBarViewModel` to build and expose a `StateFlow<TopBarState>` based on the current user role and navigation route.
