## Original Request
Create a composable dialog that displays the list of available themes. It will observe the current theme from `ThemeViewModel` and call the update function upon user selection. It will include previews for each theme.

## Thought Process
The `ThemeSelectorDialog` is the primary user interface for changing themes. It needs to be intuitive and provide clear feedback. Including theme previews within the dialog is a key UX requirement to help users make an informed choice.
