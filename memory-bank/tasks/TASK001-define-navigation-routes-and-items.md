# [TASK001] - Define Navigation Routes and Items

**Status:** Completed
**Added:** 2025-07-15
**Updated:** 2025-07-16

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan:** [docs/implementation-plans/feature-bottom-navigation-bar.md](docs/implementation-plans/feature-bottom-navigation-bar.md)

## Original Request
Define the sealed class `BottomNavItem` to hold properties for each navigation item (route, label resource, icon resource). Update `AppNavigation` to include routes for all screens accessible from the bottom bar.

## Thought Process
This is the foundational step for the bottom navigation bar. By defining the navigation items in a sealed class, we create a type-safe and centralized definition for all possible destinations. This makes it easier to manage and less prone to errors.
