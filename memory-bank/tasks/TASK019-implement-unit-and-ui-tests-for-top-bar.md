# [TASK019] - Implement Unit and UI Tests for Top Bar

**Status:** In Progress
**Added:** 2025-07-15
**Updated:** 2025-07-17

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan:** [docs/implementation-plan-documents/feature-top-navigation-bar.ipd.md](docs/implementation-plan-documents/feature-top-navigation-bar.ipd.md)
**Source PRD:** [docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-top-navigation-bar.prd.md](docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-top-navigation-bar.prd.md)

## Original Request
Write JUnit tests for the `TopBarViewModel` to verify state logic for different roles and screens. Write Compose UI tests for the `TopAppBar` and its interaction with dialogs.

## Thought Process
Testing is critical for a complex component like the top bar. Unit tests for the `TopBarViewModel` will validate the business logic that determines the bar's state. UI tests will verify that the `TopAppBar` renders correctly based on that state and that user interactions (like opening dialogs) work as expected.

## Implementation Plan Reference
- **Task ID**: TASK-006 (from plan)
- **Description**: Implement Unit and UI Tests
- **Files to Edit/Create**: `TopBarViewModelTest.kt`, `TopAppBarTest.kt`
