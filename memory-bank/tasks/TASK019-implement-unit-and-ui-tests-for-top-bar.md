**Status:** Pending
**Added:** 2025-07-15
**Updated:** 2025-07-16

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan:** [docs/implementation-plan-documents/feature-top-navigation-bar.ipd.md](docs/implementation-plan-documents/feature-top-navigation-bar.ipd.md)

## Original Request
Write JUnit tests for the `TopBarViewModel` to verify state logic for different roles and screens. Write Compose UI tests for the `TopAppBar` and its interaction with dialogs.

## Thought Process
Testing is critical for a complex component like the top bar. Unit tests for the `TopBarViewModel` will validate the business logic that determines the bar's state. UI tests will verify that the `TopAppBar` renders correctly based on that state and that user interactions (like opening dialogs) work as expected.
