## Original Request
Write JUnit tests for the `TopBarViewModel` to verify state logic for different roles and screens. Write Compose UI tests for the `TopAppBar` and its interaction with dialogs.

## Thought Process
Testing is critical for a complex component like the top bar. Unit tests for the `TopBarViewModel` will validate the business logic that determines the bar's state. UI tests will verify that the `TopAppBar` renders correctly based on that state and that user interactions (like opening dialogs) work as expected.
