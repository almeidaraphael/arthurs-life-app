# [TASK006] - Implement Unit and UI Tests

**Status:** Pending
**Added:** 2025-07-15
**Updated:** 2025-07-15

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan:** [docs/implementation-plans/feature-bottom-navigation-bar.md](docs/implementation-plans/feature-bottom-navigation-bar.md)
**Source PRD:** [docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-bottom-navigation-bar.md](docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-bottom-navigation-bar.md)

## Original Request
Write JUnit tests for the `BottomNavViewModel` to verify role-based logic. Write Espresso/Compose tests for the `BottomNavigationBar` to verify UI behavior and appearance.

## Thought Process
Testing is a non-negotiable part of the process. Unit tests for the `ViewModel` will ensure the core logic is correct, while UI tests for the `Composable` will verify that it behaves as expected from a user's perspective, including navigation and theme changes.
