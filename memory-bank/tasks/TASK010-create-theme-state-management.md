# [TASK010] - Create Theme State Management

**Status:** Pending
**Added:** 2025-07-15
**Updated:** 2025-07-15

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan:** [docs/implementation-plans/feature-theme-system.md](docs/implementation-plans/feature-theme-system.md)

## Original Request
Create a `ThemeViewModel` responsible for fetching the available themes, getting the current user's theme from the `ThemeRepository`, and providing a function to update the theme. It will expose the current theme via a `StateFlow`.

## Thought Process
The `ThemeViewModel` acts as the bridge between the data layer (`ThemeRepository`) and the UI. It will hold the state of the current theme and expose it to the UI, allowing composables to react to theme changes. This is a standard and effective use of the ViewModel pattern in a Compose architecture.
