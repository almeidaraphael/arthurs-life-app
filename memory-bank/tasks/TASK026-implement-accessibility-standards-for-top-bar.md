## Original Request
Implement comprehensive accessibility standards for the Top Navigation Bar and all related dialogs to meet PRD User Story TB-4 requirements.

## Thought Process
The PRD specifically requires WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with 4.5:1 color contrast, full TalkBack support, semantic roles, and 48x48dp touch targets. This is a critical requirement that needs dedicated implementation to ensure the app is accessible to all users.

- **Files to Edit/Create**: All top bar and dialog files, accessibility test files
