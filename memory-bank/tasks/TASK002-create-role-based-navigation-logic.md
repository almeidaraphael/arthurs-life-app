# [TASK002] - Create Role-Based Navigation Logic

**Status:** Completed
**Added:** 2025-07-15
**Updated:** 2025-07-16

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan:** [docs/implementation-plans/feature-bottom-navigation-bar.md](docs/implementation-plans/feature-bottom-navigation-bar.md)

## Original Request
Create a `ViewModel` to determine which `BottomNavItem`s to display based on the current user's role and admin status. This ViewModel will expose a state Flow of the current list of navigation items.

## Thought Process
Separating the logic for determining navigation items into a `ViewModel` is crucial for adhering to Clean Architecture. It keeps the UI layer (`Composable`) clean and focused on rendering, while the `ViewModel` handles the business logic of user roles.
