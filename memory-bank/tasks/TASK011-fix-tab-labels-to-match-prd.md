**Status:** Completed
**Added:** 2025-07-16
**Updated:** 2025-07-16

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan:** [docs/implementation-plans/feature-bottom-navigation-bar-prd-fixes.md](docs/implementation-plans/feature-bottom-navigation-bar-prd-fixes.md)
**Source PRD:** [docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-bottom-navigation-bar.md](docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-bottom-navigation-bar.md)

## Original Request
Fix tab labels to match PRD requirements exactly.

## Thought Process
The PRD specifies exact labels for caregiver tabs. Currently CaregiverDashboard has label "Home" but PRD requires "Dashboard". This needs to be corrected to meet acceptance criteria.

## Implementation Plan Reference
- Update CaregiverDashboard label from "Home" to "Dashboard"
- Verify all other labels match PRD specifications
- Update tests to reflect correct labels

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
