## Why This Project Exists

LemonQwest App addresses the need for a safe, engaging, and effective way for families to manage daily routines, motivate children, and foster positive habits. The app solves the problem of low engagement and lack of structure in family task management by combining gamification, accessibility, and robust caregiver tools.

## Problems Solved

- Children lack motivation and feedback for daily tasks
- Caregivers need efficient tools to assign, monitor, and analyze tasks for multiple children
- Families require a secure, offline, and privacy-compliant solution
- Need for positive reinforcement and achievement tracking

## How It Should Work

- Children view and complete assigned tasks, earn tokens, unlock achievements, and redeem rewards
- Caregivers create, assign, and monitor tasks, manage templates, and analyze progress
- All features work offline, with real-time feedback, audit logging, and accessibility compliance

## User Experience Goals

- Intuitive, child-friendly, and theme-aware UI. Theme system is user-based, persistent (per-user), extensible (dynamic theme registration), and fully accessible (contrast, TalkBack), as per [feature-theme-system.ipd.md].
- Instant feedback and motivational messaging
- Seamless navigation for both children and caregivers
- High accessibility (TalkBack, color contrast, semantic roles)
- COPPA compliance and local data privacy
