# TASK-002 - Implement the Top Navigation Bar Composable

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-07-15  
**Updated:** 2025-07-17

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan Document (IPD):** [feature-top-navigation-bar.ipd.md](../feature-top-navigation-bar.ipd.md)
**Source PRD:** [feature-top-navigation-bar.prd.md](../../../docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-top-navigation-bar.prd.md)

## Original Request
Create a composable that renders the UI based on the `TopBarState`. It will handle the layout of elements and delegate click events to the ViewModel or a navigation handler.

## Thought Process
This is the core UI component for the top navigation bar. It should be a stateless composable that receives the `TopBarState` and callbacks for user interactions. This keeps the UI logic separate from the state management logic, which is handled by the `TopBarViewModel`.
