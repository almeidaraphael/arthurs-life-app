# TASK-003 - Implement Required Dialogs

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-07-15  
**Updated:** 2025-07-17

## Source Documents

**Implementation Plan Document (IPD):** [feature-top-navigation-bar.ipd.md](../feature-top-navigation-bar.ipd.md)
**Source PRD:** [feature-top-navigation-bar.prd.md](../../../docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-top-navigation-bar.prd.md)

## Original Request

Create or refactor the required dialog composables. Ensure they are self-contained and can be triggered from the top bar.

## Thought Process

The top bar acts as a trigger for many different dialogs. This task involves ensuring all these dialogs (`ProfileDialog`, `SettingsDialog`, etc.) are implemented as clean, reusable composables. They should be independent of the screen they are shown on, receiving all necessary data and callbacks as parameters.
