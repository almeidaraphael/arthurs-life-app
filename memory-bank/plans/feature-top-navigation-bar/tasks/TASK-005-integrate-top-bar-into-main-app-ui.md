# TASK-005 - Integrate Top Bar into Main App UI

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-07-15  
**Updated:** 2025-07-17

## Source Documents

**Implementation Plan Document (IPD):** [feature-top-navigation-bar.ipd.md](../feature-top-navigation-bar.ipd.md)
**Source PRD:** [feature-top-navigation-bar.prd.md](../../../docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-top-navigation-bar.prd.md)

## Original Request

Add the `TopAppBar` to the main app scaffold, ensuring it's placed correctly and receives the `TopBarState`.

## Thought Process

This is the final integration step for the top bar UI. Placing it in the `topBar` slot of the main `AppScaffold` ensures it is displayed consistently across all relevant screens. It will be driven by the state exposed by the `TopBarViewModel`.
