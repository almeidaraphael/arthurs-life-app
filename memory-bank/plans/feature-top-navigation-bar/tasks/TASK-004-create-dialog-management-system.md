# TASK-004 - Create a Dialog Management System

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-07-15  
**Updated:** 2025-07-17

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan Document (IPD):** [feature-top-navigation-bar.ipd.md](../feature-top-navigation-bar.ipd.md)
**Source PRD:** [feature-top-navigation-bar.prd.md](../../../docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-top-navigation-bar.prd.md)

## Original Request
Implement a centralized system to show/hide dialogs. The `TopBarViewModel` will request dialogs, and a higher-level `MainViewModel` or manager will control which dialog is currently visible.

## Thought Process
Managing dialog state can get messy if handled independently on each screen. A centralized `DialogManager` or similar mechanism, likely coordinated by the `MainViewModel`, will prevent multiple dialogs from appearing at once and provide a single source of truth for which dialog (if any) should be displayed. This is a robust pattern for handling dialogs in a complex app.
