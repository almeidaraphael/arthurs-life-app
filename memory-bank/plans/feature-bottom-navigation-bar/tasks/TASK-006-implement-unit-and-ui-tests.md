# TASK-006 - Implement Unit and UI Tests

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-07-15  
**Updated:** 2025-07-15

## Source Documents

**Implementation Plan Document (IPD):** [feature-bottom-navigation-bar.ipd.md](../feature-bottom-navigation-bar.ipd.md)
**Source PRD:** [feature-bottom-navigation-bar.prd.md](../../../docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-bottom-navigation-bar.prd.md)

## Original Request

Write JUnit tests for the `BottomNavViewModel` to verify role-based logic. Write unit tests for `BottomNavItem` sealed class. Write Compose UI tests for the `ThemeAwareBottomNavigationBar` to verify theme behavior, navigation clicks, and accessibility. Note: Integration tests already exist in `MainAppNavigationTest.kt`.

## Thought Process

Testing is a non-negotiable part of the process. Unit tests for the `ViewModel` will ensure the core logic is correct, while UI tests for the `Composable` will verify that it behaves as expected from a user's perspective, including navigation and theme changes.

## Progress Log

### 2025-07-15

- Task created from implementation plan.

### 2025-07-16

- **ANALYSIS COMPLETED**: Updated task scope based on current implementation status
- **Integration tests verified**: MainAppNavigationTest.kt already provides comprehensive coverage for:
  - Role-based navigation structure
  - Tab navigation functionality  
  - Theme compatibility testing
  - Navigation state management
  - Back navigation handling
- **Remaining gaps identified**: Unit tests for BottomNavViewModel and BottomNavItem, component-level UI tests for ThemeAwareBottomNavigationBar
- **Task scope updated**: Focused on missing unit and component tests rather than duplicating existing integration coverage
- **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**:
  - Created comprehensive unit tests for BottomNavViewModel (role-based logic, authentication state)
  - Created unit tests for BottomNavItem sealed class (route validation, role mapping)
  - Created UI tests for ThemeAwareBottomNavigationBar (navigation, themes, accessibility)
  - Files created: BottomNavViewModelTest.kt, BottomNavItemTest.kt, ThemeAwareBottomNavigationBarTest.kt
- **TASK COMPLETED**: All detekt violations fixed, build verification successful
  - Fixed UserRole import path in BottomNavItemTest.kt (domain.user instead of domain.auth)
