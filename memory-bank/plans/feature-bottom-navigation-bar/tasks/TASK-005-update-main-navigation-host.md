# TASK-005 - Update Main Navigation Host

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-07-15  
**Updated:** 2025-07-16

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan Document (IPD):** [feature-bottom-navigation-bar.ipd.md](../feature-bottom-navigation-bar.ipd.md)
**Source PRD:** [feature-bottom-navigation-bar.prd.md](../../../docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-bottom-navigation-bar.prd.md)

## Original Request
Modify the main `NavHost` to include the `MainScreen` which contains the scaffold and bottom navigation. Ensure the `NavController` is correctly passed down.

## Thought Process
This step connects the navigation graph with the new UI structure. It's a critical wiring step to ensure that the `NavController` is available to both the `NavHost` for screen transitions and the `BottomNavigationBar` for handling clicks.
