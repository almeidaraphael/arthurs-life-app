## Original Request

Integrate the `BottomNavigationBar` into the main app scaffold. The scaffold will manage the visibility of the bottom bar based on the current route.

## Thought Process

This is the integration step where the new component becomes part of the main application UI. Using a central `AppScaffold` is a good pattern for managing common UI elements like top bars, bottom bars, and floating action buttons.
