# TASK-008 - Implement User-Based Theme Selection

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** 2025-07-17  
**Updated:** 2025-07-17

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan Document (IPD):** [feature-theme-system.ipd.md](../feature-theme-system.ipd.md)
**Source PRD:** [/docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-theme-system.prd.md](../../../docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-theme-system.prd.md)

## Original Request
Implement user-based theme selection as specified in the updated PRD. All users (children and caregivers) must be able to select any available theme, independent of role. Update all UI, persistence, and logic to match the new requirements.

## Thought Process
The previous implementation was role-based. The new PRD requires user-based selection, so all logic, UI, and persistence must be updated. This includes the theme selector dialog, theme persistence, and instant UI updates for all users.

## IPD Reference
- REQ-001: User-based theme selection
- REQ-002: Persistent theme preferences
- REQ-003: Instant UI updates for all users
