# TASK-007 - Implement Unit and UI Tests for Theme System


**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** 2025-07-15  
**Updated:** 2025-07-17 (extended 2025-07-17 for accessibility and color contrast validation)

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan Document (IPD):** [feature-theme-system.ipd.md](../feature-theme-system.ipd.md)  
**Source PRD:** [/docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-theme-system.prd.md](../../../docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-theme-system.prd.md)

## Original Request
Write unit tests for the ViewModel and Repository. Write UI tests to verify the dialog's functionality and that theme changes are correctly applied across the app.

## Thought Process
Comprehensive testing is essential. Unit tests will validate the logic of the `ThemeRepository` and `ThemeViewModel`. UI tests will ensure the `ThemeSelectorDialog` works correctly and, most importantly, that selecting a theme properly updates the application's appearance.

## IPD Reference
- STEP-007: Implement Unit and UI Tests


## Implementation Summary
The theme system has been comprehensively tested, but **automated accessibility and color contrast validation are not yet implemented**. The following test suites are complete, but additional work is required:

### Unit Tests
- **`ThemeRepositoryTest.kt`** - 40+ test cases covering theme retrieval, saving, available themes, and integration scenarios
- **`ThemeViewModelTest.kt`** - Complete test coverage for ViewModel state management and use case integration
- **`ThemeUseCasesTest.kt`** - Domain layer use case testing
- **`AppThemeSimpleTest.kt`** - Domain model testing

### UI Tests
- **`ThemeSelectorTest.kt`** - Complete UI test suite for theme selection component (25+ test cases)
- **`ThemePersistenceTest.kt`** - Comprehensive theme persistence testing across app restarts (15+ test cases)
- **`ThemeSystemTest.kt`** - End-to-end theme system integration testing
- **`ThemeAwareTopNavigationBarTest.kt`** - Theme-aware top navigation component testing
- **`ThemeAwareBottomNavigationBarTest.kt`** - Theme-aware bottom navigation component testing

### Accessibility and Color Contrast Validation (In Progress)
- Automated accessibility validation for all theme-aware UI components (Compose semantics, TalkBack, roles, labels, minimum tap targets)
- Automated color contrast validation (4.5:1) for all theme previews and dialog elements
- Manual accessibility and color contrast validation as backup

### Test Coverage Highlights
- All theme system components tested from domain to UI layers
- Complete test coverage for multiple user roles (Child, Caregiver, Admin)
- Comprehensive theme persistence testing across app restarts
- Edge case and error scenario testing
- **Accessibility and color contrast validation in progress**
- Performance and concurrency testing


## Progress Tracking
**Overall Status:** In Progress

## Progress Log
### 2025-07-15
- Task created from implementation plan.

### 2025-07-16
- Task renumbered from TASK018 to TASK025 as part of feature-based reorganization
- Updated task ID references and numbering throughout

### 2025-07-17
- Implemented comprehensive test suite for theme system (see above).
- **Gap identified:** No automated accessibility or color contrast validation tests present.
- **Action:** Extended task scope to include:
  - Automated accessibility validation for all theme-aware UI components (Compose semantics, TalkBack, roles, labels, minimum tap targets)
  - Automated color contrast validation (4.5:1) for all theme previews and dialog elements
- **Status:** Task set to In Progress until all accessibility and color contrast validation requirements are fully implemented and validated.
