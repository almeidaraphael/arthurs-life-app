# TASK-007 - Implement Unit and UI Tests for Theme System

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-07-15  
**Updated:** 2025-07-18 (completed all accessibility and color contrast validation tests)

## Source Documents

**Implementation Plan Document (IPD):** [feature-theme-system.ipd.md](../feature-theme-system.ipd.md)  
**Source PRD:** [/docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-theme-system.prd.md](../../../docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-theme-system.prd.md)

## Original Request

Write unit tests for the ViewModel and Repository. Write UI tests to verify the dialog's functionality and that theme changes are correctly applied across the app.

## Thought Process

Comprehensive testing is essential. Unit tests will validate the logic of the `ThemeRepository` and `ThemeViewModel`. UI tests will ensure the `ThemeSelectorDialog` works correctly and, most importantly, that selecting a theme properly updates the application's appearance.

> **Update 2025-07-17:**
> All theme system tests are now user-based. Test coverage for multi-role logic is marked as legacy. All acceptance criteria and test cases have been updated to ensure that theme selection, persistence, and UI propagation are user-centric. Any role-based test logic has been removed or deprecated.

## IPD Reference

- STEP-007: Implement Unit and UI Tests (now user-based)

## Implementation Summary

The theme system has been comprehensively tested, but **automated accessibility and color contrast validation are not yet implemented**. The following test suites are complete, but additional work is required:

### Unit Tests

- **`ThemeRepositoryTest.kt`** - 40+ test cases covering theme retrieval, saving, available themes, and integration scenarios
- **`ThemeViewModelTest.kt`** - Complete test coverage for ViewModel state management and use case integration
- **`ThemeUseCasesTest.kt`** - Domain layer use case testing
- **`AppThemeSimpleTest.kt`** - Domain model testing

### UI Tests

- **`ThemeSelectorTest.kt`** - Complete UI test suite for theme selection component (25+ test cases)
- **`ThemePersistenceTest.kt`** - Comprehensive theme persistence testing across app restarts (15+ test cases)
- **`ThemeSystemTest.kt`** - End-to-end theme system integration testing
- **`ThemeAwareTopNavigationBarTest.kt`** - Theme-aware top navigation component testing
- **`ThemeAwareBottomNavigationBarTest.kt`** - Theme-aware bottom navigation component testing

### Accessibility and Color Contrast Validation (Completed)

- **`ThemeAccessibilityTest.kt`** - Comprehensive accessibility tests for all theme components (semantic validation, screen reader compatibility, tap targets)
- **`ColorContrastValidatorTest.kt`** - Complete color contrast validation test suite with WCAG 2.1 compliance testing
- **`ThemeAccessibilityValidationTest.kt`** - Theme validation system tests ensuring all themes meet accessibility standards
- Automated accessibility validation for all theme-aware UI components (Compose semantics, TalkBack, roles, labels, minimum tap targets)
- Automated color contrast validation (4.5:1 AA, 7:1 AAA) for all theme color combinations

### Test Coverage Highlights

- All theme system components tested from domain to UI layers
- Complete test coverage for user-based theme selection and persistence
- Comprehensive theme persistence testing across app restarts
- Edge case and error scenario testing
- **Complete accessibility and color contrast validation testing**
- Performance and concurrency testing

## Progress Log

### 2025-07-15

- Task created from implementation plan.

### 2025-07-16

- Task renumbered from TASK018 to TASK025 as part of feature-based reorganization
