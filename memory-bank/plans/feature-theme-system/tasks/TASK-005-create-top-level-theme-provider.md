# TASK-005 - Create a Top-Level Theme Provider

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-07-15  
**Updated:** 2025-07-17

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan Document (IPD):** [feature-theme-system.ipd.md](../feature-theme-system.ipd.md)

## Original Request
The main `Activity` or a top-level composable (`ArthurLifeApp`) will host the `ThemeViewModel` (likely via a `MainViewModel`). It will collect the current `AppTheme` from the ViewModel and wrap the entire UI content in the corresponding theme provider (`MarioClassicTheme`, `MaterialTheme`, etc.), making it available via `LocalBaseTheme`.

## Thought Process
This is the highest level of integration for the theme system. By placing the theme provider at the root of the UI tree, we ensure that the selected theme is propagated down to all composables via the `LocalBaseTheme` `CompositionLocal`. This is the standard, idiomatic way to handle theming in Jetpack Compose.

| 24.1 | Modify `MainViewModel.kt` to include `ThemeViewModel` logic or instance | Completed  | 2025-07-17  | Not needed - ThemeViewModel used directly in ArthursLifeTheme |
| 24.2 | In `ArthurLifeApp.kt`, collect the current theme from the ViewModel | Completed  | 2025-07-17  | Implemented in ArthursLifeTheme function           |
| 24.3 | Wrap the main content in a `when` statement that applies the correct theme provider | Completed  | 2025-07-17  | Uses AppTheme composable for proper theme provider integration |

## Progress Log
### 2025-07-15
- Task created from implementation plan.

### 2025-07-16
- Task renumbered from TASK017 to TASK024 as part of feature-based reorganization
- Updated task ID references and numbering throughout

### 2025-07-17
- Started TASK024 implementation
- Analyzing MainActivity.kt to understand current top-level theme integration
- Found: Top-level theme provider already fully implemented in MainActivity.kt
- Verified: ArthursLifeTheme composable collects theme from ThemeViewModel
- Verified: Theme loading triggered by user role changes via LaunchedEffect
- Verified: MaterialTheme provider wraps entire app with current theme properties
- Verified: Theme integration points: colorScheme, typography, shapes from BaseAppTheme
- Verified: ThemeViewModel instance passed down through app navigation hierarchy
- Verified: Complete theme propagation from top-level to all navigation screens
- Analysis: Implementation follows exactly the requirements from task specification
- Updated: Modified MainActivity.kt to use AppTheme composable instead of MaterialTheme directly
- Added: currentAppTheme property to ThemeViewModel to expose AppTheme value
- Fixed: Theme provider integration to use LocalBaseTheme composition local properly
- Verified: App builds successfully and installs without errors
- Validated: Zero tolerance policy enforced - detekt passes, builds successfully
- Status: TASK024 completed successfully - top-level theme provider fully integrated
