# TASK-004 - Implement Theme Selector Dialog

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-07-15  
**Updated:** 2025-07-17 (extended 2025-07-17 for accessibility, error handling, notification theming)

## Source Documents

**Implementation Plan Document (IPD):** [feature-theme-system.ipd.md](../feature-theme-system.ipd.md)  
**Source PRD:** [/docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-theme-system.prd.md](../../../docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-theme-system.prd.md)

## Original Request

Create a composable dialog that displays the list of available themes. It will observe the current theme from `ThemeViewModel` and call the update function upon user selection. It will include previews for each theme.

## Thought Process

The `ThemeSelectorDialog` is the primary user interface for changing themes. It needs to be intuitive and provide clear feedback. Including theme previews within the dialog is a key UX requirement to help users make an informed choice.
