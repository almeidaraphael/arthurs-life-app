# TASK-004 - Implement Theme Selector Dialog


**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** 2025-07-15  
**Updated:** 2025-07-17 (extended 2025-07-17 for accessibility, error handling, notification theming)

## Source Documents
**Implementation Plan Document (IPD):** [feature-theme-system.ipd.md](../feature-theme-system.ipd.md)  
**Source PRD:** [/docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-theme-system.prd.md](../../../docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-theme-system.prd.md)

## Original Request
Create a composable dialog that displays the list of available themes. It will observe the current theme from `ThemeViewModel` and call the update function upon user selection. It will include previews for each theme.

## Thought Process
The `ThemeSelectorDialog` is the primary user interface for changing themes. It needs to be intuitive and provide clear feedback. Including theme previews within the dialog is a key UX requirement to help users make an informed choice.

## Progress Log
### 2025-07-15
- Task created from implementation plan.

### 2025-07-16
- Task renumbered from TASK016 to TASK023 as part of feature-based reorganization
- Updated task ID references and numbering throughout

### 2025-07-17
- Initial implementation and integration of ThemeSelectorDialog completed (see above).
- **Gap identified:** Accessibility only partially implemented (missing full Compose semantics, minimum tap targets, and automated a11y validation).
- **Gap identified:** No user-facing error messages for theme load failures; fallback exists but user is not notified.
- **Gap identified:** System notifications are not theme-aware.
- **Action:** Extended task scope to include:
  - Full Compose accessibility semantics (TalkBack, roles, labels, minimum tap targets)
  - Automated and manual color contrast validation (4.5:1)
  - User-facing error messages for theme load failures
  - System notification theming
- **Status:** Task set to In Progress until all accessibility, error handling, and notification theming requirements are fully implemented and validated.
