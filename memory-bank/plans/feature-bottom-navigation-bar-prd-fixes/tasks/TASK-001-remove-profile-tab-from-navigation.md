# TASK-001 - Remove Profile Tab from Navigation

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-07-16  
**Updated:** 2025-07-16

## Source Documents

**Implementation Plan Document (IPD):** [feature-bottom-navigation-bar-prd-fixes.ipd.md](../../feature-bottom-navigation-bar-prd-fixes/feature-bottom-navigation-bar-prd-fixes.ipd.md)
**Source PRD:** [feature-bottom-navigation-bar.prd.md](../../../docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-bottom-navigation-bar.prd.md)

## Original Request

Fix PRD violations in bottom navigation bar - currently showing 5 tabs instead of maximum 4 as required by PRD.

## Thought Process

The PRD clearly states FR2: "The navigation bar must never display more than four tabs." Currently, both Child and Caregiver roles show 5 tabs including Profile. According to the PRD acceptance criteria:

- Child should have: Home, Rewards, Tasks, Achievements (4 tabs)
- Caregiver should have: Dashboard, Tasks, Rewards, Users/Children (4 tabs)

Profile tab is not mentioned in the PRD requirements and must be removed to meet compliance.
