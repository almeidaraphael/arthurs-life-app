# TASK-002 - Add Admin Status to User Model

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-07-16  
**Updated:** 2025-07-16

## Source Documents

**Implementation Plan Document (IPD):** [feature-bottom-navigation-bar-prd-fixes.ipd.md](../../feature-bottom-navigation-bar-prd-fixes/feature-bottom-navigation-bar-prd-fixes.ipd.md)
**Source PRD:** [feature-bottom-navigation-bar.prd.md](../../../docs/product-requirements-documents/feature-bottom-navigation-bar.prd.md)

## Original Request

Add admin status differentiation to support Users vs Children tab for caregivers as required by PRD.

## Thought Process

The PRD specifies that caregivers must have different fourth tabs based on admin status:

- Family Admin: Shows "Users" tab
- Non-Admin: Shows "Children" tab

Currently, the User domain model doesn't have an admin status property. We need to add this to enable proper role-based navigation.
